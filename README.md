# Classification Of Handwritten Digits
This is an implementation of Artificial Neural Networks to classify handwritten digits. 
The model is trained using the MNIST dataset integrated with TensorFlow.
the MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing, 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits and is a modified version of the NIST dataset. An extended version of MNIST called EMNIST was published in 2017 and contains 240,000 training and 40,000 testing images.
